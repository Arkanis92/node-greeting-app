1. What is a Node module?

A node module is an encapsulated set of functions that you want included in your application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is an empty object that can be assigned to anything and will be returned from the require function. exports on the other hand is simply a reference to module.exports and will not reassign module.exports if there is already an object assigned to it.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

Exports allows the module author to write less code in general and is private to the module using it unless there is no object assigned to module.Exports
